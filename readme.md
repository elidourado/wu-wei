# Wu wei theme
无为 (traditional: 無爲) is an ancient Chinese term for effortless action.

This is the Hugo theme used at [elidourado.com](https://elidourado.com). It is most certainly not stable and remains subject to breaking changes. Use at your own risk.

That said, it is available as a hugo module for ease of import. Assuming you have a fairly standard hugo installation, add the following to your config.toml to use wu wei.

    [module.imports]
    path = "github.com/elidourado/wu-wei"

It has a few cool features:

* Search function
* Continuously dynamic font sizing based on browser width
* Mathjax support
* Support for FRED charts
* Hero image support (add #hero after the image url in markdown)
* Nifty animated corner twitter widget

I aspire to improve the theme a lot as time becomes available.

I welcome pull requests to fix bugs, improve organization, modernize features for new versions of Hugo, add unambiguously good new features, or improve the aesthetics of the theme while still maintaining the overall ambiance.

The goal is for the theme to look simple but have a lot of subtle power under the hood.
